    question: "Based on the most sensitive indicator of fluid status changes, what is the priority nursing assessment?",
    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
<p>The priority nursing assessment is to verify the reported weight gain using consistent <strong>daily weights</strong>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Daily weight is the most sensitive indicator of fluid volume changes (1 kg ≈ 1 L fluid).</li>
  <li>Consistency is key: Same time (morning, after voiding, before breakfast), same scale, similar clothing.</li>
  <li>This objective data validates the patient's report and guides further assessment and intervention (e.g., assessing for worsening HF, evaluating diuretic effectiveness).</li>

    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
<p><strong>Isotonic crystalloid solutions</strong> (e.g., 0.9% Normal Saline or Lactated Ringer's) are most appropriate for initial resuscitation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>These fluids expand the extracellular fluid (ECF) volume, specifically the intravascular space, without causing significant fluid shifts between compartments.</li>
  <li>This helps restore circulating volume and improve blood pressure in hypovolemia.</li>

<p>The nurse should question the order for 0.45% NaCl (a <strong>hypotonic solution</strong>) because it can worsen <strong>cerebral edema</strong> in patients with acute brain injury.</p>

<p>Essential nursing precautions for administering 3% NaCl include:</p>

    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
<p>The most appropriate initial nursing intervention for euvolemic hyponatremia secondary to SIADH is <strong>fluid restriction</strong>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>SIADH involves excessive water reabsorption due to high ADH levels, leading to dilutional hyponatremia.</li>
  <li>Restricting free water intake helps correct the water excess relative to sodium.</li>

    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
<p>The priority focus is <strong>safe and gradual fluid replacement</strong> to correct the water deficit, along with frequent neurological assessments.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hypernatremia indicates a water deficit relative to sodium, causing cellular dehydration (especially brain cells).</li>
  <li>Fluid replacement, typically with hypotonic solutions (e.g., D5W, 0.45% NaCl), must be administered <strong>slowly</strong> to prevent cerebral edema.</li>

<p><strong>Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome (ODS)</strong>, formerly Central Pontine Myelinolysis (CPM), is a potential neurological complication of excessively rapid correction of severe hyponatremia.</p>

<p>This positive Chvostek's sign suggests <strong>Hypocalcemia</strong>. The priority nursing action is to assess the patient's <strong>airway and respiratory status</strong> due to the risk of laryngospasm.</p>

<p>The initial priority intervention for managing moderate to severe hypercalcemia is aggressive <strong>IV hydration with 0.9% Normal Saline</strong>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hydration helps dilute the serum calcium concentration.</li>

<p>Promoting mobility and weight-bearing activity helps <strong>limit bone demineralization (resorption)</strong> caused by immobilization.</p>

    question: "Why might this gauge size be problematic for transfusing Packed Red Blood Cells (PRBCs), and what should the nurse consider?",
    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
<p>A 24-gauge catheter may be problematic because its small lumen can increase resistance to flow, potentially slowing the infusion rate significantly and increasing the risk of <strong>hemolysis</strong> (damage to red blood cells) as they pass through the narrow catheter.</p>
<ul>
  <li>PRBCs are viscous.</li>
  <li>Standard practice recommends using a larger gauge catheter (e.g., 18-gauge or 20-gauge) for PRBC transfusion in adults to ensure adequate flow and minimize cell damage.</li>
  <li>The nurse should consider establishing larger bore IV access if possible, especially if rapid infusion is needed or multiple units are ordered. If not possible, the infusion may need to run slower, increasing the risk of exceeding the 4-hour limit.</li>

<p>This action is incorrect because blood products should <strong>ONLY</strong> be administered with <strong>0.9% Sodium Chloride (Normal Saline)</strong>.</p>

<p>Inconsistent timing for daily weights leads to inaccurate and unreliable data for assessing fluid status trends.</p>

<p>The nurse must monitor serum <strong>Potassium (K+)</strong> and serum <strong>Calcium (Ca++)</strong> levels closely.</p>

  <li>Hypomagnesemia frequently coexists with and contributes to refractory hypokalemia.</li>
  <li>Magnesium is essential for the function of renal mechanisms that retain potassium and for the Na+/K+ cellular pump.</li>
