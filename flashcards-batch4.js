      <li>The goal is typically to keep the drainage light pink and free of significant clots.</li>

    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
    <p>The kidneys play a major role in blood pressure regulation via the <strong>Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS)</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>KEY STEPS OF RAAS:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>When kidneys sense decreased blood pressure/perfusion or low sodium, juxtaglomerular cells release <strong>RENIN</strong>.</li>

      <li>Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE), mainly in the lungs, converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II.</li>
      <li>Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor (increases BP) and stimulates the adrenal cortex to release <strong>ALDOSTERONE</strong>.</li>
      <li>Aldosterone causes the kidneys to retain sodium and water, increasing blood volume and BP.</li>

    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
    <p>The initial BUN/Cr ratio was high (60/1.5 = 40:1), strongly suggesting a <strong>pre-renal cause</strong> (dehydration). The improvement in BUN and Cr levels with IV fluid resuscitation confirms this.</p>
    <p><strong>INTERPRETATION:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The disproportionately high BUN initially reflected increased urea reabsorption due to low flow state/dehydration.</li>
      <li>IV fluids restored renal perfusion, allowing the kidneys to excrete waste products more effectively.</li>
      <li>The significant drop in BUN relative to the smaller drop in Creatinine, along with the normalization of the ratio (30/1.2 = 25:1, moving towards normal), indicates resolution of the pre-renal azotemia and improvement in kidney function.</li>

    <p>The most likely underlying reason is the <strong>long-term immunosuppression therapy</strong> required to prevent transplant rejection.</p>

      <li>Immunosuppressive medications (e.g., tacrolimus, mycophenolate, prednisone) lower the patient's immune response to prevent the body from attacking the transplanted kidney.</li>
