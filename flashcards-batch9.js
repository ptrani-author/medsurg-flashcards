    question: "Based on these findings, which condition is most likely, and what is the priority nursing intervention related to functional ability?",
    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
<p>The clinical presentation and X-ray findings are most consistent with <strong>Osteoarthritis (OA)</strong>. The priority nursing intervention related to functional ability is education on <strong>weight management</strong>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>OA is a degenerative joint disease characterized by cartilage breakdown, often affecting weight-bearing joints.</li>
  <li>Symptoms include pain worsened by activity, brief morning stiffness (<30 mins), and crepitus.</li>
  <li>X-rays show joint space narrowing, osteophytes, and subchondral sclerosis.</li>
  <li>Weight loss significantly reduces stress on weight-bearing joints like the hip and knee, improving pain and function.</li>
  <li>Other interventions include low-impact exercise, analgesics (acetaminophen first-line), and joint protection strategies.</li>

    question: "What category of medication is the cornerstone of RA treatment to prevent joint destruction, and what is a key nursing consideration when administering these?",
    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
<p><strong>Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs)</strong>, including biologics, are the cornerstone of RA treatment. A key nursing consideration is monitoring for signs of <strong>infection</strong> due to immunosuppression.</p>
<ul>
  <li>RA is a chronic, systemic, autoimmune inflammatory disease.</li>
  <li>DMARDs work to suppress the underlying autoimmune process, slowing disease progression and preventing joint erosion.</li>
  <li>Common DMARDs include methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, and biologic agents (e.g., TNF inhibitors).</li>
  <li>Because these drugs suppress the immune system, patients are at increased risk for infections. Nurses must monitor for fever, sore throat, cough, or other signs of infection and educate patients on infection prevention measures (e.g., hand hygiene, avoiding crowds, vaccinations).</li>

<p>For an acute muscle strain, <strong>cold therapy (Ice)</strong> is typically indicated in the first 24-48 hours.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Strains involve injury to muscles or tendons.</li>
  <li>Initial phase involves inflammation and potential micro-tearing.</li>
  <li>Ice application (cryotherapy) causes vasoconstriction, which helps to:
    <ul>
      <li>Decrease pain.</li>
      <li>Reduce swelling (edema).</li>
      <li>Minimize inflammation and muscle spasm.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Heat application is generally recommended after the acute inflammatory phase (usually post-48 hours) for strains to increase blood flow, promote healing, and reduce muscle stiffness/spasm. (Contrast with sprains where RICE is the mainstay initially).</li>

    scenario: "A patient who had a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) yesterday has Hemovac drain output of 150 mL over the past 8 hours. The dressing is dry and intact. Vital signs are stable.",
    question: "Is this amount of drainage concerning, and what is the primary purpose of the drain in this context?",
    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
<p>This amount of drainage (approximately 19 mL/hr) is generally considered <strong>within acceptable limits</strong> for the first 24 hours post-TKA, but should be monitored closely for trends. The primary purpose of the drain is to remove excess fluid and blood from the surgical site to <strong>prevent hematoma formation</strong> and reduce pressure/swelling.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Post-operative drainage after TKA can be significant initially (e.g., up to 400-500 mL in the first 24 hours is possible, though variable).</li>
  <li>Key Nursing Actions:

  <li>While assessing for crepitus can be part of the exam, it should not be intentionally elicited repeatedly as it can cause pain.</li>

    scenario: "A patient with a known allergy to shellfish is prescribed glucosamine and chondroitin supplements for osteoarthritis symptoms.",
    question: "What specific concern should the nurse address with the patient and provider regarding this supplement?",
    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
<p>The nurse should address the concern that <strong>glucosamine supplements are often derived from shellfish shells</strong>. Patients with shellfish allergies may have an allergic reaction to these supplements.</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is crucial to verify the source of the glucosamine supplement.</li>
  <li>The patient should be advised to discuss this potential allergy risk with their provider before starting the supplement.</li>
  <li>There may be non-shellfish derived glucosamine products available, or alternative therapies might be considered.</li>
  <li>Always assess for allergies before administering any new medication or supplement.</li>

    scenario: "Following a motor vehicle accident, a patient has an unstable pelvic fracture.",
    question: "What is the most immediate life-threatening complication the nurse must monitor for with an unstable pelvic fracture?",
    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
<p>The most immediate life-threatening complication of an unstable pelvic fracture is severe <strong>Hemorrhage</strong> (internal bleeding).</p>
<ul>
  <li>The pelvis houses major blood vessels (e.g., iliac arteries and veins) and has a rich vascular supply within the bone itself.</li>
  <li>Fracture fragments can easily lacerate these vessels, leading to massive retroperitoneal or intraperitoneal bleeding.</li>
  <li>Priority Nursing Assessments:
    <ul>
      <li>Frequent monitoring of vital signs for signs of shock (hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, pallor, diaphoresis).</li>
      <li>Assessing for abdominal distention, tenderness, or guarding.</li>
      <li>Monitoring urine output.</li>
      <li>Monitoring hemoglobin and hematocrit levels.</li>
      <li>Assessing peripheral pulses and skin perfusion.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Minimize patient movement until the pelvis is stabilized (e.g., with a pelvic binder or external fixation). Anticipate fluid resuscitation and potential surgical intervention.</li>

    question: "What are the key areas of patient education regarding potential serious side effects and required monitoring for methotrexate therapy?",
    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
<p>Key patient education for methotrexate includes monitoring for signs of <strong>bone marrow suppression</strong>, <strong>liver toxicity</strong>, and <strong>infection risk</strong>, along with the importance of regular lab monitoring.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Bone Marrow Suppression:</strong> Report signs of infection (fever, chills, sore throat), anemia (fatigue, pallor), or bleeding/bruising (thrombocytopenia). Requires regular CBC monitoring.</li>
  <li><strong>Hepatotoxicity:</strong> Report jaundice, abdominal pain, persistent nausea/vomiting, dark urine. Avoid alcohol. Requires regular liver function tests (LFTs).</li>
  <li><strong>Infection Risk:</strong> Practice infection prevention (hand hygiene, avoid sick contacts). Report any signs of infection promptly.</li>
  <li><strong>Folic Acid:</strong> Usually prescribed concurrently to reduce side effects; emphasize importance of taking as directed.</li>
  <li><strong>Teratogenicity:</strong> Counsel women of childbearing age about the need for effective contraception during and for a period after therapy.</li>
  <li>Regular follow-up and lab work (CBC, LFTs, creatinine) are crucial for safe use.</li>

    question: "What instructions should the nurse provide regarding the application and monitoring of the compression bandage?",
    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
<p>The nurse should instruct the patient on proper application technique and signs of potential complications related to the compression bandage.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Application:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Wrap snugly but not too tightly, starting distally (at the toes/foot) and moving proximally (towards the leg).</li>
      <li>Overlap the bandage by about half its width with each turn.</li>
      <li>Ensure even pressure distribution. Avoid wrinkles.</li>

  <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Check circulation, sensation, and movement (neurovascular status - "5 Ps") in the toes frequently after application and periodically thereafter.</li>
      <li>Ensure the toes are warm, pink, with good capillary refill (<3 seconds).</li>
      <li>Report immediately if toes become numb, tingly, cold, pale, or bluish, or if pain increases significantly after application (may indicate bandage is too tight).</li>
      <li>Remove the bandage for bathing (unless otherwise instructed) and reapply as needed.</li>
      <li>Remove or loosen the bandage if neurovascular compromise is suspected.</li>
