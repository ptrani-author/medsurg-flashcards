    question: "How should the nurse interpret the patient's respiratory pattern in the context of the ABG results?",
    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
<p>The rapid, deep respirations (<strong>Kussmaul breathing</strong>) represent a <strong>respiratory compensation</strong> for the underlying <strong>metabolic acidosis</strong>.</p>

  <li>The low pH (7.20) indicates acidosis.</li>

  <li>Normal PaO2 range is 80-100 mmHg on room air.</li>

    question: "What does the trend in Troponin I levels indicate?",
    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
<p>The <strong>rising trend</strong> in Troponin I levels indicates ongoing myocardial injury and <strong>confirms the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI)</strong>.</p>

    question: "What is the rationale for repleting magnesium before or concurrently with potassium in this situation?",

<p>Magnesium is essential for the function of the sodium-potassium pump and renal potassium regulation; therefore, hypokalemia is often <strong>refractory to treatment unless hypomagnesemia is corrected first</strong>.</p>

    scenario: "A nurse is assessing a patient's peripheral pulses. The radial pulse feels weak and thready.",
    question: "What associated vital sign finding would be most consistent with this pulse quality, and what underlying condition might it suggest?",
    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
<p><strong>Hypotension</strong> (low blood pressure) would be the most consistent associated vital sign finding. This pulse quality often suggests <strong>decreased cardiac output or hypovolemia</strong>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pulse Quality Interpretation:
    <ul>
      <li>A weak, thready pulse (decreased amplitude, easily obliterated) reflects reduced stroke volume or peripheral vasoconstriction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Associated Conditions:
    <ul>
      <li>Hypovolemic shock (hemorrhage, dehydration)</li>
      <li>Cardiogenic shock (heart failure, MI)</li>
      <li>Severe sepsis</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Nursing Assessment: Check blood pressure, assess skin temperature/color, capillary refill, urine output, and mental status to evaluate perfusion.</li>

    scenario: "A patient is admitted following a stroke resulting in right-sided weakness and dysphagia. The nursing diagnosis is Risk for Aspiration R/T impaired swallowing.",
    question: "List three essential independent nursing interventions to minimize aspiration risk for this patient.",
    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
<p>Essential independent nursing interventions to minimize aspiration risk include:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Positioning:</strong> Elevate the head of the bed to 90 degrees (High Fowler's) during and for at least 30-60 minutes after meals or oral intake.</li>
  <li><strong>Diet Modification Checks:</strong> Ensure patient receives prescribed consistency (e.g., thickened liquids, pureed diet) as recommended by speech therapy; check trays before serving.</li>
  <li><strong>Feeding Techniques:</strong> Encourage small bites/sips, slow pace, check for pocketing of food in the affected (right) side of the mouth, ensure mouth is clear before offering more, minimize distractions during meals.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>Other interventions: Provide oral care before/after meals, monitor respiratory status during/after intake, have suction available at bedside.</li>

    scenario: "A patient's SpO2 reading via pulse oximeter is 86%. The patient is alert, skin is warm and pink, respiratory rate is 16/min with unlabored effort, and nail beds are clean.",
    question: "Before initiating oxygen therapy based solely on the SpO2 reading, what is the nurse's priority action?",
    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
<p>The priority action is to <strong>troubleshoot the pulse oximeter reading</strong> by assessing the probe placement and checking for factors that can cause inaccurate readings.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Factors Affecting Accuracy:
    <ul>
      <li>Incorrect probe placement or poor fit.</li>
      <li>Poor peripheral perfusion (cold extremities, hypotension, peripheral vascular disease).</li>
      <li>Patient movement or shivering.</li>
      <li>Nail polish (especially dark colors) or artificial nails.</li>
      <li>Severe anemia (SpO2 may be normal despite low oxygen content).</li>
      <li>Carbon monoxide poisoning (falsely high reading).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Interventions: Check probe connection, reposition probe (try different finger, earlobe, forehead), warm the extremity, remove nail polish if possible, correlate with patient's clinical presentation. If reading remains low after troubleshooting and clinical signs suggest hypoxia, then intervene.</li>

    question: "Which option is a correctly written, specific nursing intervention?",
    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
<p>Option <strong>3</strong> is the correctly written, specific nursing intervention: "Assess respiratory status including rate, depth, effort, SpO2, and lung sounds every 2 hours and PRN."</p>
