    question: "What is the nurse's most accurate and important teaching point regarding sexual transmission risk in this situation?",
    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
<p>The most important teaching point is that maintaining an undetectable viral load through consistent ART adherence makes the risk of sexually transmitting HIV effectively zero (<strong>Undetectable = Untransmittable or U=U</strong>).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reinforce the critical importance of continued ART adherence to maintain the undetectable viral load.</li>
  <li>Discuss that U=U applies specifically to sexual transmission; other STIs can still be transmitted, so condom use may still be advised for STI prevention.</li>
  <li>Assess the patient's understanding and address any concerns or misconceptions about U=U.</li>

    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
<p>The primary concern is the potential for HIV viral replication and the development of <strong>drug resistance</strong>.</p>

<p>The primary difference lies in speed and specificity:</p>

  <li><strong>Innate Immunity:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Response Time: <strong>Rapid</strong> (minutes to hours).</li>

  <li><strong>Adaptive (Acquired) Immunity:</strong>

    question: "How should the nurse explain the cause of Kaposi's sarcoma lesions in the context of AIDS?",
    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
<p>The nurse should explain that Kaposi's sarcoma is a type of cancer caused by <strong>Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8)</strong>, which typically only causes disease when the immune system is severely weakened, as occurs in AIDS.</p>
<ul>
  <li>KS causes abnormal tissue growth (lesions) under the skin, in the lining of the mouth, nose, and throat, or in other organs.</li>
  <li>Lesions appear as purple, red, or brown patches or nodules on the skin.</li>
  <li>It is considered an <strong>AIDS-defining illness</strong>.</li>

<p>The potential complication necessitating prolonged observation is a <strong>biphasic reaction</strong>.</p>

<p>The nurse's priority action is to <strong>notify the healthcare provider immediately</strong> for further evaluation to differentiate between an SLE flare and an infection.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Both SLE flares and infections can present with similar non-specific symptoms like fever, malaise, and fatigue.</li>
  <li>Patients with SLE are often on immunosuppressive medications, increasing their infection risk, and infections can sometimes trigger flares.</li>

<p><strong>Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)</strong> are commonly prescribed to manage GERD symptoms in scleroderma.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scleroderma often causes esophageal dysmotility and lower esophageal sphincter dysfunction, leading to severe acid reflux.</li>

  <li><strong>IgM antibodies</strong> usually appear earlier in the infection and decline over several months. Negative IgM suggests the infection is not recent or acute.</li>

<p>The fundamental pathophysiological process is an exaggerated vascular response (<strong>vasospasm</strong>) of digital arteries and arterioles to cold temperatures or emotional stress.</p>

<p>T Helper (CD4+) cells are crucial because they act as central coordinators or <strong>"conductors"</strong> of the adaptive immune response.</p>

<p>Immunological memory means that after exposure to a specific antigen (like those in a vaccine), the adaptive immune system <strong>"remembers"</strong> it.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Vaccination introduces harmless forms or components of a pathogen (antigens) to the body.</li>
  <li>This triggers an initial adaptive immune response involving B cells and T cells, creating specific <strong>memory cells</strong> (memory B cells and memory T cells).</li>
