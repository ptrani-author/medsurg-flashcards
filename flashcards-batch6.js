    question: "What is the primary safety risk associated with discontinuing exogenous steroids, and how should the nurse educate the patient about the tapering process?",
    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
    <p>The primary safety risk is precipitating <strong>acute adrenal insufficiency (Addisonian crisis)</strong> due to suppression of the HPA axis. The nurse must educate the patient on the critical importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed <strong>gradual tapering schedule</strong>.</p>

    <p>These findings suggest the <strong>Somogyi effect</strong> (rebound hyperglycemia). The appropriate adjustment is typically to <strong>decrease the evening/bedtime dose</strong> of basal or intermediate-acting insulin, and potentially add or adjust a bedtime snack.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> The 3 AM hypoglycemia indicates excessive insulin effect overnight, triggering counter-regulatory hormone release that causes high morning glucose.</li>
      <li><strong>Differentiation:</strong> Checking 2-3 AM blood glucose is key. Low = Somogyi; Normal/High = Dawn Phenomenon.</li>
      <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> Address the underlying hypoglycemia by reducing the offending insulin dose.</li>

    scenario: "A patient with diabetes reports consistently high blood glucose levels upon waking around 7 AM. They check their blood glucose at 3 AM and find it is normal or slightly elevated (e.g., 140 mg/dL).",
    question: "Which glycemic phenomenon do these findings suggest, and what is a potential adjustment to the patient's evening insulin regimen?",
    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
    <p>These findings suggest the <strong>Dawn Phenomenon</strong>. A potential adjustment is to <strong>increase the evening/bedtime dose</strong> of basal or intermediate-acting insulin, adjust the timing of the evening insulin, or use insulin pump adjustments.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> The Dawn Phenomenon is caused by a normal nocturnal surge of counter-regulatory hormones (e.g., growth hormone, cortisol) leading to increased glucose production. The 3 AM glucose is not low.</li>
      <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> Provide more insulin coverage during the early morning hours when hormone levels rise.</li>

    question: "What are the most important instructions regarding insulin administration and monitoring during illness?",
    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
    <p>The most important instructions are to <strong>continue taking insulin</strong> (often needing more, not less), <strong>monitor blood glucose frequently</strong> (e.g., every 2-4 hours), and <strong>check urine or blood for ketones frequently</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Key Sick Day Rules:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Never omit insulin:</strong> Illness/stress often increase glucose levels and insulin needs. Contact provider for dose adjustments if unsure or unable to eat.</li>
          <li><strong>Monitor BG Frequently:</strong> Check q 2-4 hours.</li>
          <li><strong>Monitor Ketones:</strong> Check urine/blood ketones q 4 hours, especially if BG >240 mg/dL.</li>
          <li><strong>Maintain Hydration:</strong> Sip small amounts of sugar-free fluids frequently; consume sugar-containing fluids if unable to eat solid food to prevent hypoglycemia.</li>

    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
    <p>Essential components of daily foot care include <strong>inspection</strong>, <strong>hygiene</strong>, and <strong>protection</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Key Education Points:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Inspect Daily:</strong> Visually inspect all surfaces of the feet (using a mirror if needed) and between toes for redness, blisters, cuts, cracks, or sores.</li>
          <li><strong>Wash Daily:</strong> Wash feet with lukewarm water and mild soap; dry thoroughly, especially between toes.</li>
          <li><strong>Moisturize:</strong> Apply lotion to tops and bottoms, but avoid area between toes (to prevent fungal infection).</li>
          <li><strong>Nail Care:</strong> Cut toenails straight across, file sharp edges. Seek podiatrist care if vision is poor or nails are thick/ingrown.</li>
          <li><strong>Protect Feet:</strong> Always wear well-fitting shoes and socks. Never go barefoot. Check inside shoes for foreign objects before putting them on.</li>

    question: "Why is strict blood pressure control particularly important in patients with diabetes, and what class of antihypertensive medication is often preferred?",
    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
    <p>Strict blood pressure control is crucial in diabetes to reduce the risk of both <strong>macrovascular complications</strong> (heart attack, stroke) and <strong>microvascular complications</strong> (nephropathy, retinopathy). <strong>ACE Inhibitors (ACE-I)</strong> or <strong>Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs)</strong> are often preferred classes.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Hypertension significantly accelerates atherosclerotic disease and damage to small blood vessels, risks already heightened by diabetes.</li>
      <li><strong>ACE-I/ARBs Benefits:</strong> Besides lowering BP, they offer specific renal protective effects, slowing the progression of diabetic nephropathy.</li>

    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
    <p><strong>Gastrointestinal side effects</strong> (diarrhea, cramping, nausea) are common with somatostatin analogs like octreotide. Long-term monitoring of <strong>gallbladder function</strong> (ultrasound) is often warranted due to the risk of <strong>gallstone formation</strong>.</p>

    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
    <p>The most significant risk is developing <strong>acute adrenal insufficiency (Addisonian crisis)</strong> due to inadequate hormone replacement, especially during times of stress.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Bilateral adrenalectomy results in complete absence of endogenous cortisol and aldosterone production.</li>
      <li><strong>Post-op Monitoring:</strong> Vigilantly monitor for hypotension, hypoglycemia, fatigue, nausea/vomiting.</li>
      <li><strong>Lifelong Management:</strong> Requires consistent daily medication adherence.

    question: "While primary hyperthyroidism usually involves a suppressed TSH, what potential underlying cause should be considered with this specific lab pattern?",
    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
    <p>An elevated TSH level in the presence of high T4/T3 suggests <strong>secondary hyperthyroidism</strong>, most commonly caused by a <strong>TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> In primary hyperthyroidism (e.g., Graves' disease, toxic nodule), the high T4/T3 levels suppress TSH release from the pituitary via negative feedback. If TSH is inappropriately normal or high despite elevated thyroid hormones, it indicates the pituitary itself is the source of the problem, overstimulating the thyroid gland.</li>
      <li><strong>Next Steps:</strong> Further investigation, typically including pituitary imaging (MRI), is required.</li>
