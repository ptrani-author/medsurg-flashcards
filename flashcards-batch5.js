    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
    <p>The nurse's priority action is to anticipate and prepare for the initiation of <strong>empiric, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy immediately</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>PID requires prompt treatment to prevent long-term complications like infertility and ectopic pregnancy.</li>
      <li>Treatment is often initiated based on clinical findings (pelvic pain, CMT, adnexal tenderness) even before confirmatory test results are available.</li>

    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
    <p>The most critical potential condition to investigate first is <strong>endometrial cancer</strong>.</p>

    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
    <p>Discussing <strong>combined hormonal contraceptives (OCPs) or progestin-only therapy</strong> would be appropriate.</p>

    <p>Essential safety education includes warning the patient about the risk of <strong>orthostatic hypotension and dizziness</strong>.</p>

    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
    <p>The primary long-term health risk is <strong>endometrial hyperplasia and potentially endometrial cancer</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chronic anovulation leads to prolonged exposure of the endometrium to estrogen without the counterbalancing effects of progesterone (which is typically produced after ovulation).</li>
      <li>This "unopposed estrogen" stimulates endometrial growth (hyperplasia), increasing the risk of atypical changes and cancer over time.</li>
      <li>Management often involves hormonal therapy (e.g., combined OCPs or cyclic progestins) to induce regular withdrawal bleeding and protect the endometrium.</li>

    <p>The most crucial instruction is to <strong>abstain from all sexual intercourse for 7 days</strong> after completing single-dose therapy <strong>AND</strong> until all sexual partners from the previous 60 days have been appropriately treated.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chlamydia is highly transmissible.</li>

      <li>Taking NSAIDs with food or milk to minimize potential gastrointestinal upset.</li>

    answer: `<h3>ANSWER:</h3>
    <p>The first diagnostic test typically ordered is measurement of <strong>Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) level</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>FSH levels help differentiate between potential causes:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>High FSH</strong> suggests primary ovarian insufficiency (gonadal failure).</li>
